- Zero breaking changes to existing code
- Smooth migration path provided

### 4. Advanced Features

#### Broadcasting Support:
```rust
impl BroadcastCompatible for BitNetTensor {
    fn is_broadcast_compatible(&self, other: &Self) -> bool;
    fn broadcast_shape(&self, other: &Self) -> ShapeResult<TensorShape>;
    fn can_broadcast_to(&self, target: &Self) -> bool;
}
```

#### Memory Statistics:
```rust
pub struct TensorMemoryStats {
    pub tensor_id: u64,
    pub storage_id: u64,
    pub shape: Vec<usize>,
    pub dtype: BitNetDType,
    pub device: Device,
    pub size_bytes: usize,
    pub is_shared: bool,
}
```

#### Thread Safety:
- All structures implement `Send + Sync`
- Arc-based sharing for efficient cloning
- Thread-safe memory operations
- Fine-grained locking where needed

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tensor Creation:
```rust
use bitnet_core::tensor::{BitNetTensor, BitNetDType};

// Create tensors
let tensor = BitNetTensor::zeros(&[2, 3], BitNetDType::F32, None)?;
let data = vec![1.0f32, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0];
let tensor = BitNetTensor::from_vec(data, &[2, 2], BitNetDType::F32, None)?;

// BitNet quantized tensor
let bitnet_tensor = BitNetTensor::bitnet_158(&[100, 100], None)?;
```

### Convenience Functions:
```rust
use bitnet_core::tensor::{zeros, ones, from_f32_data, bitnet_158, BitNetDType};

let tensor1 = zeros(&[10, 20], BitNetDType::F32)?;
let tensor2 = ones(&[5, 5], BitNetDType::F32)?;
let tensor3 = bitnet_158(&[128, 128])?;
```

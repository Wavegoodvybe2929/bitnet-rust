### Benchmark Design Principles
```rust
// Example benchmark structure
fn benchmark_tensor_operations(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let mut group = c.benchmark_group("tensor_operations");
    
    for size in [128, 256, 512, 1024].iter() {
        group.throughput(Throughput::Elements(*size as u64 * *size as u64));
        group.bench_with_input(
            BenchmarkId::new("matrix_multiply", size),
            size,
            |b, &size| {
                // Benchmark implementation with proper setup/teardown
            }
        );
    }
}
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Throughput**: Operations per second, FLOPS, memory bandwidth
- **Latency**: P50, P95, P99 percentiles with statistical confidence

impl RegressionAnalysis {
    pub fn detect_regressions(&self) -> Vec<PerformanceRegression> {
        // Statistical analysis for performance changes
    }
}
```
